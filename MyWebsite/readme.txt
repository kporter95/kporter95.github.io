For my styling I changed the font to Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif. 
I also changed my name to the fantasy font.
I added the Hero image with parallax at the top and at the bottom of the website.
I also put a nav menu on the right side that changes color when you hover and it follows you as you scroll down the page.
I added the Footer at the very bottom with the correct html symbols.
I also decided to style the schedule so that every other line gets highlighted.
